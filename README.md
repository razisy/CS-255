# CS 255 Module Eight Journal – DriverPass Project Reflection

## Project Summary
The DriverPass project was based on a request from a driving school client. Their goal was to create an online system that allows students to schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, view their progress, and stay updated with DMV requirements. The system also supports office staff and administrators, helping them manage scheduling, track activity, and handle updates efficiently. My role was to gather the business requirements and then design a system that meets those needs using proper system analysis and UML diagrams.

## What I Did Well
One thing I did particularly well was creating a complete set of UML diagrams that clearly showed how the system works from both the user’s and technical perspectives. I focused on making the diagrams easy to read and understandable for nontechnical audiences, which is an important part of effective system design.

## What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, I would spend more time polishing the activity diagrams and sequence diagram for additional clarity and more realistic alternate paths. This would help better represent the complexity of real-world scenarios.

## Interpreting User Needs
I carefully reviewed the client’s goals and the interview transcript to understand what the system needed to do. I translated those needs into system features like lesson scheduling, practice testing, and DMV integration. Considering user needs is essential because a system is only successful if it solves the user’s problems and is simple for them to use.

## My Design Approach
My design approach focuses on first understanding the problem and gathering requirements, then creating clear diagrams to map out how the system should behave before jumping into development. In the future, I will continue using strategies like use case modeling, activity and sequence diagrams, and iterative feedback to design systems that meet both functional and user experience goals.
